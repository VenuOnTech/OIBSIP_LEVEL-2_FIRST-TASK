# Advanced Calculator
## Description
This is an Advanced Calculator built as part of my first project during the Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship in Web Development. The calculator supports various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, exponential calculations, and more. It also includes a history tracking feature to store and review previous calculations.

## Key Features:
- Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan (in radians).
- Exponential Calculations: Calculating ùëí^ùë•.
- Square and nth Power Functions: Calculate square and other powers.
- History: Track previous calculations with an option to view and clear the history.
- User-Friendly Design: Responsive layout with easy-to-use buttons for quick calculations.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the page layout.
- CSS: For styling the calculator and making it visually appealing and responsive.
- JavaScript: For implementing the calculator's functionality, including handling user input, performing calculations, and managing history.

## Usage
- Click on the buttons to perform calculations.
- To perform operations like exponential (e^x), type e^ followed by the number you want to raise ùëí
- The history button will allow you to view your past calculations. You can clear the history with the "Clear History" button.
- The AC (clear) button resets the display, and the ‚å´ (backspace) button removes the last digit/character.
